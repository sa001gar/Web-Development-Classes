# CSS Responsive Design

CSS Responsive Design ensures that web pages look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## **Key Concepts**

- **Media Queries** – Apply styles based on device width, height, orientation, etc.
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    body { font-size: 14px; }
  }
  ```
- **Flexible Grid Layouts** – Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for fluid, adaptable layouts.
- **Fluid Images** – Ensure images scale within their containers.
  ```css
  img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }
  ```
- **Viewport Meta Tag** – Controls how the page is displayed on mobile devices.
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ```
