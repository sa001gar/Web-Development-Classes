# HTML Document Structure

HTML document structure defines how an HTML file is organized and how different elements are placed within the document to create a functional web page.

## **Basic Structure of an HTML Document**

An HTML document typically consists of the following parts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document Structure</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>HTML Document Structure</h1>
    <p>This is an example of a basic HTML document structure.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## **Main Components**

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.

### 2. `<html>`
The root element that wraps all the content on the page.

### 3. `<head>`
Contains metadata such as the document's title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

### 4. `<title>`
Specifies the title of the web page that appears on the browser tab.

### 5. `<body>`
Holds all the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, links, and other elements.

## **Nesting and Indentation**
Proper nesting and indentation help maintain a clean and readable structure. Each child element is indented inside its parent element.

## **HTML Boilerplate Code**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Boilerplate</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is the standard HTML boilerplate code.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
