HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page, while attributes provide additional information about an element.

## **What are HTML Elements?**
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
- `<p>` is the start tag.
- `This is a paragraph.` is the content.
- `</p>` is the end tag.

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings
- `<p>`: Paragraph
- `<a>`: Anchor (Link)
- `<img>`: Image
- `<div>`: Division
- `<span>`: Inline container

## **What are HTML Attributes?**
Attributes provide additional details about an element. They are always included in the opening tag.

### **Example:**
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
- `href` is the attribute specifying the link's destination.

```
